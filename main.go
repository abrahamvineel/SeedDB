/*Stage 1: Build a basic in-memory key-value store with simple CRUD operations.
Stage 2: Add persistence to disk (e.g., using a write-ahead log or appending to a file).
Stage 3: Add concurrency using goroutines, locks, and channels.
Stage 4: Implement an LSM Tree-based or B-Tree-based on-disk storage model.
Stage 5: Scale out by implementing sharding or replication across nodes. */
